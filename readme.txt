== Description ==

Auhtor Advertising Pro is a powerful and complete Google Ads Manager Plugin. It respects to 100% the Adsense Rules! Make your blog like a paid to write system by sharing adsense impression between your users.

It works fine also with Wordpress Network mode (Multi-Blog) such as WPMU.

This plugin allows you to create a real "paid to write" website, allowing you to manage every aspect of this system.
Each user will have the ability to insert Adsense codes in your profile allowing easy sharing of impressions.
You can easily choose what percentage allocated to each user role.

Author Advertising Pro has been developed by Gianluca Marzaro, on the basis of the Author Advertising 2.9.2 developed by Harley, this choice is based on the fact that many Web sites already have this version of the plugin and have a large database user codes and pub-id and / or ad_slot.
In this way you can simply disable Auhtor Advertising 2.9.2 and install / enable Auhtor Advertising Pro to have all the new features without having to modify or create new database users.

Since version 5.0 the plugin has been completely renovated.
It has a dedicated menu and many new functions.

It allows managing an unlimited number of adsense ads, thanks to the new Google Ad Manager.
Allows you to preset up to 6 different Ad_slot them available to the users.
It allows authors to invite others to join your site, and encourage this practice by allowing them to earn a percentage of impressions of articles written by their referrals. (See Referral Mode)
It allows you to manage every aspect of the user.
It has easy to integrate into your site shortcode.
New mode Admin mode, which allows you to share impressions across multiple members simultaneously.

And much more.
